#By default, the following characters treated as fields.

#Space
#Tab
#newline
#If your text includes any of these characters, the shell will assume itâ€™s a new field.
#you can change the internal field separator or IFS environment variable. like this:

#IFS=$'\n'    For newlines
#IFS=:        For colons

#It will consider new lines as a separator instead of spaces.

#Example 1 with test file with newlines
file="testfilewithstuff.txt"
IFS=$'\n'

for var in $(cat $file); do
    echo "$var"
done

#Example 2 with PATH output

file="pathexample"
IFS=:

for var in $(cat $file); do
    echo "$var"
done
